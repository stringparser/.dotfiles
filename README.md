# setup

Create a bare repo to track dotfiles.

```sh
git clone --bare https://github.com/stringparser/dotfiles.git code/dotfiles
```

Setup an alias to use git from that repository.

```sh
echo 'alias dit="/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/code/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME"' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```

Since we are tracking the whole `$HOME` folder, let's skip untracked files

```sh
dit config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

That's it. You can use that repo to track files across your system.

```sh
config add .eslintrc
config add .zshrc
```

There are some usage caveats (like path completion) you might also want to disable showing untracked files.
